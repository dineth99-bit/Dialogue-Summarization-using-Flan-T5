# Dialogue-Summarization-using-Flan-T5
The lab will explore how the input text affects the model's output and involve prompt engineering to direct the model toward the desired task. By comparing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences, the lab will demonstrate the first steps of prompt engineering and show how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models.
